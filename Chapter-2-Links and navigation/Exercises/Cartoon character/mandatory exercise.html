        <p>(previously known as PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds) is a battle royale game developed by PUBG Studios and published by Krafton. The game, which was inspired by the Japanese film Battle Royale (2000), is based on previous mods created by Brendan "PlayerUnknown" Greene for other games, and expanded into a standalone game under Greene's creative direction. It is the first game in the PUBG Universe series.</p>

        <p>PUBG represents the standalone version of what Greene believes is the "final version" of the battle royale concept, incorporating the elements he had designed in previous iterations.[6][33] Faster development was possible with the game engine Unreal Engine 4, compared with ARMA and H1Z1, which were built with proprietary game engines. Greene acknowledged that implementing the size of the maps in PUBG has been one of the challenges with working with Unreal, which was not designed with such maps in mind</p>

        <p>PUBG's Ranked Mode offers a competitive experience, allowing players to gauge their skills and compete with others at a similar level. The rank system divides players into tiers such as Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, Master, and Grandmaster, with divisions within each tier.</p>
